# PICTURE FILTERS APPLICATION

Welcome! This is an application I made for a final project in April 2024. It is a software that manipulates the picture that is pre-uploaded. Here, you can adjust filter intensities, and view the menu for different ways you can manipulate the filter of the detected face. Enjoy using the application!

To launch the application:
1. open the code in VSCode or any of your preferred IDE
2. open the code in LIVE PREVIEW
3. copy the URL generated in the live preview and paste in your desired browser (google chrome or mozilla firefox is recommended)
4. enjoy!
